# ðŸŽ¨ Mood Palet

This application allows the user to automatically generate a palette of five colors from an input picture. It then allows users to save and manage their palettes, as well as share them publicly on the web.

### Features

- Upon application startup at the root path (./), the database is initialized using the schema.sql script.


- User accounts can be created and accessed using existing credentials.


- Publicly accessible palets collection page for users.


- Each palette has a unique, shareable 8-character URL.


- Logged-in users can delete self-created palets through a "Delete palet" button on the palet page.


- A static navigation bar provides options for user logout and returning to the personal page.


**Online alpha version:**

- public user palets: [moodpalet.pxly.fr/palets/renÃ©](https://moodpalet.pxly.fr/palets/ren%C3%A9)
